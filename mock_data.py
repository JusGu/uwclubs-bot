message = '''📍EOT Christmas Party🎄Thursday Dec 7th, from 6-8 PM in EV3 4408 <@&985326512003764224> 

🥳Don’t forget to bring your own mugs/thermos for perfect winter hot drinks! We have snacks and tea/hot chocolate🍵☕️
Although it’s said to be a party, please take it as a club event like the previous Halloween party (so NO drinking/school-inappropriate behaviours etc.)

⛄️In short, a chill drawing session! Feel free to chat with other artists, enjoy some hot drinks, and work on your arts/schoolwork. You can also plan a meet up with your Secret Santa art trade pair during the party, if both of you are available.
